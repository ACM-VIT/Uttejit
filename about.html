						      <h4>FS TEAM UTTEJIT</h4>
						      <p>FS Team Uttejit is the official formula hybrid team of VIT University, Vellore. The team’s roots extend
							  back to 2013, where its groundwork was laid to manufacture a high performance vehicle keeping its
							  environmental footprint in mind. Four years on, as the reigning champions of Asia’s largest Formula
							  student competition- the ISIE-HVC, we can say that we have been fairly successful in that pursuit. This
							  has been made possible by a group of passionate engineers from varied backgrounds coming together
							  and channelizing their energy towards the shared goal of making the best car we can. However, we view
							  it not as a mission which ends at a destination but as a neverending journey- a journey where the quest
							  for progress guides us forward. This ideology has been the driving force behind us deciding to take up
							  the challenge of proving our mettle on foreign soil as we take part in the FSAE Formula Hybrid to be held
	  						  in New Hampshire International Speedway, New Loudon inthe coming season.</p>

						      <h4>OUR MISSION</h4>
						      <p>Our mission is to design and manufacture high performance vehicles which are efficient and
environmentally conscious. The car resulting from our hardwork is put through its paces in events
organized by SAE. The aim is always to give our best in both the static as well as dynamic events. The
results from the competition are the tangible indicatorsof how much we have improved and where we
stand- our report card at the end of a season. But as a formula hybrid team we believe we are part of
something greater. Given the recent push by several governments worldwide including India for
substantial emission reductions in automobiles, we are observing a much required injection of funds and
research into the hybrid industry as a whole. Hybrids are now recognized as the bridge between today
and tomorrow and it gives us immense pleasure and satisfaction to be a small part of this big revolution.</p>

						      <h4>OUR PHILOSOPHY</h4>
						      <p>It is a common conception to perceive performance and efficiency to be two very different parameters
unrelated - or worse- contradictory to each other. We strive to show by example that better efficiency
leads to better performance. They are the two sides of the same coin, it’s hard to improve one without
significant progress in the other. The Formula 1 community too woke up to the advantages of using a
hybrid powertrain in 2014, and the entire world has seen the positive effects on performance due to this
shift. Likewise, we aim to redefine the performance expectations from a formula student team through
our continued push towards better efficiency. At the end of the day, everyone likes it when their
hardwork results in meaningful output- we just take this theory and extend it to cars!</p>

						      <h4>THE COMPETITION</h4>
						      	<p>Formula student is among the world’s most prestigious and well established academic motorsport
competitions which allows students who are interested in motorsports, engineering, and technology
a realistic outlet to showcase their skills and talents through an innovative yearlong project. The
event began as Formula SAE in the United States in 1980. It has since grown to involve more than
400 universities, with official events being held in 10 countries around the globe. The competition

encompasses all aspects of car manufacturing, including research, construction, testing, marketing,
management, and fundraising. This presents students with the opportunity of putting their theory
into practice in a dynamic, competitive environment. Hence Formula SAE consistently produces
experienced and capable engineers to take on the challenges of tomorrow.
